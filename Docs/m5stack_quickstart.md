## Prepare a m5stack board

The main site for buying the m5stack board is its official site: https://m5stack.com/

// TODO: add more links which sell m5stack boards (especially in Iran)

## Install Arduino IDE

Download and install the parduino-1.8.19-windows](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe) version of arduino IDE. 
At the time I'm writing this documentation, arduino-2 was not a stable option to work with m5stack. 
But you can test new versions.
